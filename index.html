  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Effective date: <span id="effective-date">2025-09-14</span></p>
  <p class="meta">Canonical policy URL: <a href="https://vastlylame.github.io/us-privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://vastlylame.github.io/us-privacy-policy/</a></p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application “Unpolished” ("the App") collects, uses, and shares information. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The App displays banner advertisements using Google AdMob.</li>
    <li>The App stores your last-read page locally on your device so you can resume where you left off.</li>
    <li>The App does not collect personally identifiable information directly.</li>
    <li>For users in the EEA/UK, we will present a consent dialog (Google UMP) where required.</li>
    <li>The App is not directed to children under 13 (COPPA).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>1) Advertising (Google AdMob)</h3>
  <p>The App uses Google AdMob to show ads. AdMob may collect certain information automatically, such as device identifiers, approximate location, IP address, app interactions, and diagnostic information, to provide, personalize (where permitted), and measure ads. For details, please review Google’s policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdMob &amp; EU consent</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2) Last-read Page (Local Storage)</h3>
  <p>To improve your reading experience, the App stores the last page you viewed on your device using local preferences. This data never leaves your device and is not shared.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To display and measure advertising via Google AdMob.</li>
    <li>To remember your last-read page for convenience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legal Bases and Consent (EEA/UK)</h2>
  <p>Where required by law, the App will use the Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) to request your consent for personalized advertising. You may choose to receive non‑personalized ads; in that case, AdMob will serve ads using contextual information rather than personal data.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This App is not directed to children under 13, and it is not set as child‑directed under COPPA. If you believe a child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Local last‑read page: stored only on your device until you clear the App’s data or uninstall.</li>
    <li>Advertising data: handled by Google AdMob according to their retention policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or share your personal information. Ad data may be shared with Google and its advertising partners as part of providing the AdMob service. See Google’s disclosures for details.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable measures to protect information processed by the App. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>AdMob may process data on servers located outside your country. See Google’s policies for more information.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can reset your advertising ID in your device settings.</li>
    <li>For EEA/UK, you can update your consent choices via the consent dialog if provided, or by clearing the App’s data.</li>
    <li>You can disable personalized ads from Google in your Google account Ads Settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will revise the effective date above and may provide additional in‑app notice for material changes.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
